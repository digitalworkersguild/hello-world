# hello-world

We are the [Digital Workers Guild LLC](https://digitalworkersguild.com), aka DWG. We are a new technology multi-member LLC based on co-op principles. 

Our aim is to build well designed and thoughtful software for the greater good. The greater good is about considering the shared interests, collective purpose, and common future of all people.

Our current major project is [Banchan Art](https://github.com/digitalworkersguild/banchan), an artist platform focused on providing a user-friendly space for artists for managing their clients, commissions, and invoices.
